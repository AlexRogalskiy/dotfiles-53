# dotfiles

This repo should be cloned to `$HOME/.dotfiles` for the paths to line up when running the `.masos` script. Most other files should be copied into `$HOME` directly. This could be scripted in the future.

The configuration and other goodies that make my macOS environment work how I like it.

Some of this has been inspired by other dotfiles repositories scattered around the Internet.
