# dotfiles

The configuration and other goodies that make my OS X environment work how I like it.

Some of this has been inspired by other dotfiles repositories scattered around the Internet.

I use my own themes, Pro 2 and IR_Black_Improved in OS X's Terminal.app. They're pretty similar at this point, with the main difference being Pro 2 using the colors from Apple's Pro theme, and IR_Black_Improved using my own tweaks to the IR_Black theme.
