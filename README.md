# dotfiles

Most files should be copied into `$HOME`. This could be scripted in the future.

Some of this has been inspired by other dotfiles repositories scattered around the Internet.

## Themes

Included in this repo is my custom [Brian Theme.terminal](Brian%20Theme.terminal). It uses a dark gray background with an opacity of 90% and blur of 40% and the DejaVu Sans Mono Nerd Font at 12pt (checkout [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)). I use the [Starship](https://starship.rs) prompt.
