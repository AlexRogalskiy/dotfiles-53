# dotfiles

This repo should be cloned to `$HOME/.dotfiles` for the paths to line up when running the `.macos` script. Most other files should be copied into `$HOME` directly. This could be scripted in the future.

The configuration and other goodies that make my macOS environment work how I like it.

Some of this has been inspired by other dotfiles repositories scattered around the Internet.

## Themes

Included in this repo is my custom [Brian Theme.terminal](Brian%20Theme.terminal) and [brian.zsh-theme](brian.zsh-theme). The Terminal theme is an ever branching fork of the Pro theme. INotably, it uses Dank Mono 12pt and has a background opacity of 90% and blur of 40% for a subtle transparancy effect. The zsh theme prints the hostname followed by the return status of the previous command and if in a git directory, git prompt info.
